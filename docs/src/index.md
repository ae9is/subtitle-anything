Add AI generated subtitles to any video (or audio) playing in your browser!

Subtitle Anything is:

1. Free

    > No "free trial then monthly payment". If your device supports it, you can run it forever. Free.

2. Private

    > No data leaves your device. Subtitle Anything doesn't run translations on Google's (or any other) servers.

3. Flexible

    > No site specific support: One extension. Any tab that plays audio. 99 languages plus autodetect.

If you find Subtitle Anything useful and would like to see it brought to your browser's extension store, or to have new features, please show your support by leaving a star.

Every star is appreciated! :star:
